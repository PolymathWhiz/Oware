"To play OWARE you will need a game board and forty-eight game pieces, which are so-called seeds. Usually the board consists of two rows of six holes" "located at opposite sides. Two larger holes on the sides of the board are used to store the seeds players capture during the match. The upper row" "belongs to the player""who moves first, named Player A, and the lower row belong to the second called Player B.\n\n(2) Goal 0f the game- The goal of the game is to acquire more seeds" "than your opponents.\n\n(3)Playing the Game"

"Each move of the game is done in three phases: collecting, sowing and capturing. During the sowing a player distributes the collected seeds along the board, and"" during the capture phase the player takes, if possible, the seeds found in the pits of the opponent.\n\n\n\n"
"Collecting Seeds- "

"In the first phase of a movement, the player who is to move chooses one of the holes on his own side of the board and collects all the seeds on it, leaving the hole empty. Subsequently, these seeds will be distributed on the board during the sowing phase.\n"

"A player may collect the seeds from any of the holes that belong to him if it contains one or more seeds, only with the exception that after making the move his" "opponent must be able to play." "Therefore, a move that would leave all the holes empty on the opponent's side is not legal."
"Sowing Seeds-\n\n"

"During sowing, the player distributes the seeds collected in the first phase along the board in a counter clockwise direction; dropping one seed in each of the" "playing holes until all the seeds are distributed. A player will never sow on the holes used for storage.After sowing the seeds, the hole from which the player" "has collected seeds will be empty. It may well be the case that the player sows twelve or more seeds, in which case the player will sow them going round around" "the board, dropping one seed in each hole in every round, but never dropping a seed in the hole from which the seeds were collected.\n\n\n"
"Capturing Seeds-\n\n"

"When the last sown seed is dropped in one of the holes belonging to the opponent, and after dropping the seed the hole contains exactly two or three seeds, the" "player will capture them. Taking all the seeds from the hole and saving them in his own store.\n"

"When the hole immediately to the right of the last pit from which seeds were captured contains also two or three seeds, the player will capture them too. And" "so"" on until the player cannot capture more seeds, always taking into account that players can only capture seeds from their opponents holes and never from" "their own holes.""\n\n""(4)End of the game- The game is ended when a player has more seeds than his opponent and there are no seeds left to distribute or" "sow""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTO PROCEED TO GAME PLAY PRESS THE ENTER KEY..\n""\n\n\n");
